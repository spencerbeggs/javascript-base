# JavaScript Base

This repository is a [GitHub Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that I use to setup a development workspace for a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) project using [EMCAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). It includes configurations for [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well as a bootstrapper cli to reset the template for a new project.

To get starts, clone the template into your GitHub account:

```zsh
yarn install
yarn bootstrap # reset the project
yarn test # run the tests
yarn start # run the main entry point as a script
```
